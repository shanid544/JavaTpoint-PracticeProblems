* An object has three characteristics: State: represents the data (value) of an object.
                                       Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
                                       Identity: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not visible to the external user.                                          However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.

* Object Definitions: An object is a real-world entity.
                      An object is a runtime entity.
                      The object is an entity which has state and behavior.
                      The object is an instance of a class.
                      
* A class in Java can contain: Fields
                               Methods
                               Constructors
                               Blocks
                               Nested class and interface
* class <class_name>{  
    field;  
    method;  
} 

* Instance variable in Java:   A variable which is created inside the class but outside the method is known as an instance variable. Instance variable doesn't get       memory at compile time. It gets    memory at runtime when an object or instance is created. That is why it is known as an instance variable.
* Method in Java:  a method is like a function which is used to expose the behavior of an object.
  Advantage of Method : Code Reusability
                        Code Optimization

* new keyword in Java : The new keyword is used to allocate memory at runtime. All objects get memory in Heap memory area.
* Object and Class Example: main within the class : 
* 3 Ways to initialize object: By reference variable
                               By method
                               By constructor
* As you can see in the above figure, object gets the memory in heap memory area. The reference variable refers to the object allocated in the heap memory area. Here,   s1 and s2 both are reference variables that refer to the objects allocated in memory.(https://www.javatpoint.com/object-and-class-in-java)

* what are the different ways to create an object in Java?
  By new keyword
  By newInstance() method
  By clone() method
  By deserialization
  By factory method etc.
* Anonymous object
  Anonymous simply means nameless. An object which has no reference is known as an anonymous object. It can be used at the time of object creation only.
  new Calculation();//anonymous object  
  new Calculation().fact(5);  //Calling method through an anonymous object
  normal Calculation c=new Calculation();  
  c.fact(5);//Calling method through a reference:
