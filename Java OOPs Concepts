*  The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as a truly object-oriented programming language.
* Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. 
* Smalltalk is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language
* Apart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design:
  > Coupling 
  > Cohesion 
  > Association 
  > Aggregation 
  > Composition
* Object
  > An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory.
  > Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code. The only necessary thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response       returned by the objects.
* Class
  > Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.
  > A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. Class doesn't consume any space.
* Inheritance
  > When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime     polymorphism
* Polymorphism
  > If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape,       triangle, rectangle, etc.
  > In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.
* Abstraction
  > Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.
  >  we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
  > 
* Encapsulation
  > Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation. For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
  > A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private here.
